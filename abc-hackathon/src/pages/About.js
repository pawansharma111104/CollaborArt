      <h2>About CollaborArt</h2>
      <p>
        CollaborArt uses blockchain technology to transparently track each creator's contribution to a project,
        ensuring clear ownership and fair compensation. Our platform mints NFTs with embedded metadata about
        each contributor's effort, enabling creators to receive ongoing royalties from sales.
